- Get real-time feedback and **adjust based on your progress**.

### 📅 History & Analytics
- Review logs for any date using a **calendar view**.
- Analyze trends with a **7-day overview** and **AI-generated insights** offering actionable advice.

### 🔐 Secure Authentication
- Sign up and log in using **email/password** or **Google OAuth**.
- Authentication is securely managed by **Supabase Auth**.

### 🎨 Theming
- **Dark mode by default** for a sleek look.
- Optional **light mode with a vibrant orange theme**.

### 📤 Export to Sheets *(Planned)*
- Export your data to Google Sheets or CSV for external analysis.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Macro-check follows a **modern three-tier architecture**:


### 1️⃣ Frontend (React Native App)
- Provides the **UI for user interactions**.
- Handles **authentication** directly with Supabase Auth.
- For all other data (logs, goals, analytics), it **communicates with the FastAPI backend** via authenticated requests.

### 2️⃣ Backend (FastAPI Server)
- Acts as the **"brain" of the application**.
- Responsibilities include:
  - Securely integrating with the **OpenRouter API** for AI-powered insights.
  - Calculating daily and weekly **analytics**.
  - Managing the **Redis cache** for performance.
  - Handling database operations for user logs, goals, and history.

### 3️⃣ Third-Party Services (Supabase)
- **Supabase Auth** – Handles email/password logins, Google OAuth, password hashing, and JWT generation.
- **Supabase Database** – Provides a production-ready managed PostgreSQL database for application data.

This decoupled design ensures:
- **Scalability** – Each layer can grow independently.
- **Security** – Authentication is delegated to Supabase.
- **Maintainability** – Clear separation of concerns.
